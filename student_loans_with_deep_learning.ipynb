This would be context-based filtering, due to the separation of individual users.  The most important driving factor for the selection of loan options is the specific loan being requested.  The individualized ranking of the available options (normally a short list, such as payment terms) can be derived from the standard in-coming profile listed above.  General preferences of others isn't as important as the capacity of the individual's ability to pay back the loan.  In addition, once the co-signer comes into play, there are two separate populations providing information.  The number of existing bank customers matching both profiles will be limited, and recommendation systems sneed very large data sets.  That will most likely not be the case in this situation.  \n","\n","  \n","3. A) The main concern would be the availability of sufficient training data.\n"," With restricted data, the model would likely suffer, but shortfalls could be mitigated by designing the system to only be used in ranking the available options (after adjusting for feasibility of repayment, the analog version of the analysis generated previously in the module).  If the recommendation is in error, then the \"correct\" options will someply be delayed.\n"," B) Using Loan selection as the main driver for loan options presentation means that other options that may make different types of loans more enticing may be ignored.  Although useful for up-selling or optimizing the options of present loans, this model cannot be used in \"sell-across\" drives to encourage existing customers to take out other / additional different loans.\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
